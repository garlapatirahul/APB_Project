# APB Protocol - System Verilog Test bench
APB is a low power, low bandwidth consuming interface bus for any peripherals in ARM SoC's.Implements simple read/write protocols to interface peripherals.

APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol implements a master-slave configuration.APB Bridge acts as a master that tranaslates from AMBA interface to APB Protocol.APB slave will respond for APB transactions just like any peripheral would.
